# Ephemerals

This is a basic program for "ephemeral" URL research. It is still in early development so you probably **shouldn't** run it. It basically runs through a list of websites and stores their requests.

## Configuration

## Inputs

**All inputs are in the following format**:

```json
{"category": ["hostname1", "hostname2"]}
```

## Running

You can find instructions to run the tools in their respective folders.
